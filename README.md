# Maze
Kia Ora

This is an app that solves a maze through Depth First Searching. This has an animation created by a thread which you can play to see how the depth first searching works.
This currently has two mazes which are shown in the text files - if you would like you can always make your own just follow the same format in order for the app to work as intended.
Hope you enjoy/
